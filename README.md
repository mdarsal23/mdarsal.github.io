## Introduction
Hello, I am Md Arsal Asif, a sophomore at IIT Kanpur.

I was experimenting deploying a github page.

Since I didn't really decide what to do with it, here are some good cinema recommendations from my side :) (all of the films listed below are checked by a good film critic(me))

## **Movies**
### Romcom : NOT IN ORDER (except the first three)
1. [La La Land](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/) (Most magical yet realistic film)
2. [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/) (Jim Carrey you beauty)
3. [10 Things I Hate About You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/) (Honestly I saw it for heath Ledger but oh that poem scene!)
4. [500 Days of Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/) (But it's not a romantic film, is it?)
5. [The Notebook](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280/) (Would've loved it more if it had a tragic ending)
6. [Notting Hill](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125439/) (This film was an oscillation between "I wish I was this guy" and "This shit should never happen to me")
7. [Serendipity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/) (Serendipity)
8. [Rockstar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839596/) (Ranbir Kapoor left no choice but to love this movie)
9. [Tamasha](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140465/) (Unexpectedly good)
10. [Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/) (but to me it felt more like existential crisis)
11. [The Fall Guy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081859/) (This felt like an experimental film which turned out good)

Don't take me for a hopeless romantic (that doesn't mean I'm not, just don't take it :)
